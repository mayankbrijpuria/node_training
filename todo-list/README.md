# Todo List

In this project we will be developing a todo list app. Your job is to implement the following functionality:

- When text is entered into the input bar and a click is performed on the submit button, a new line item should be generated.
- After submission, the input box should clear automatically.
- **Bonus:** Create a strikethrough of the specific line item when the delete link is clicked.
- **Super Bonus:** Use HTML5 localStorage to persist the todo data through page refreshes.
